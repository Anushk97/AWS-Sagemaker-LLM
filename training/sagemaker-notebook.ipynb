In 1967, the country co-founded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Race riots broke out once more in 1969. Lee Kuan Yew's emphasis on rapid economic growth, support for business entrepreneurship, and limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore's policies for the next half-century. Economic growth continued throughout the 1980s, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999. During the 1980s, Singapore began to shift towards high-tech industries, such as the wafer fabrication sector, in order to remain competitive as neighbouring countries began manufacturing with cheaper labour. Singapore Changi Airport was opened in 1981 and Singapore Airlines was formed. The Port of Singapore became one of the world's busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period.\", 'response': 'Yusof bin Ishak', 'category': 'closed_qa'}\n"

      "To decorate your new home, its good to get a strong sense of your own personal style and to seek inspiration from things you like. There are certain platforms like Pinterest where you can save images that you like to get inspiration from others, and see patterns in what type of decor speaks to you. Its good to invest in certain pieces that you will use a lot, like a mattress or couch, and then search for bargains on other pieces on secondhand marketplaces like Craigslist or Facebook marketplace. If you feel totally lost and overwhelmed, there are also interior design services available online to do remotely or you can hire a personal interior designer. Sometimes it is good to live in your space for a bit before making big purchases since your ideas on how to utilize the space may evolve as you spend more time in it.\n"

    "## 3. Fine-Tune LLaMA 13B with QLoRA on Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the recently introduced method in the paper \"[QLoRA: Quantization-aware Low-Rank Adapter Tuning for Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)\" by Tim Dettmers et al. QLoRA is a new technique to reduce the memory footprint of large language models during finetuning, without sacrificing performance. The TL;DR; of how QLoRA works is: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Quantize the pretrained model to 4 bits and freezing it.\n",
    "* Attach small, trainable adapter layers. (LoRA)\n",
    "* Finetune only the adapter layers, while using the frozen quantized model for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "We prepared a [run_clm.py](./scripts/run_clm.py), which implements QLora using PEFT to train our model. The script also merges the LoRA weights into the model weights after training. That way you can use the model as a normal model without any additional code. The model will be temporally offloaded to disk, if it is too large to fit into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a sagemaker training job we need an `HuggingFace` Estimator. The Estimator handles end-to-end Amazon SageMaker training and deployment tasks. The Estimator manages the infrastructure use. \n",
    "SagMaker takes care of starting and managing all the required ec2 instances for us, provides the correct huggingface container, uploads the provided scripts and downloads the data from our S3 bucket into the container at `/opt/ml/input/data`. Then, it starts the training job by running.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can also use `g5.2xlarge` instead of the `g5.4xlarge` instance type, but then it is not possible to use `merge_weights` parameter, since to merge the LoRA weights into the model weights, the model needs to fit into memory. But you could save the adapter weights and merge them using [merge_adapter_weights.py](./scripts/merge_adapter_weights.py) after training."
